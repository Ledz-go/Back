# Master Node
The Master Node is the one parsing the message from the Smartphone andrelaying the appropriate data to the different nodes it is connected to. It has to initate a WiFi hot sport and receive WiFi connection requests from all the surrounding nodes.

## Communication Layer
TBD

## Application Layer
In the application layer we will open sockets between the different agents of the network and manage the data processing.

#### Authentication and Connection Management
TBD : Do we need a password to connect to the Master Node? SessionId creation for the connection, to be used for log messages. System status must be kept up to date and analysed

#### To Do
- [] Finite State Machine for the in messages
- [] Finite State Machine for the out messages
- [] API for the smartphone message processing
